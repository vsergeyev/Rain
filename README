Rain/Snow Lua class to use with Corona SDK
==========================================

It is about creating rain or snow effect in your
iPhone games.

Play with drop width/length/color/speed :)


Basic usage
===========

local rain = require("rain")

rain.new(group, {})


Pause rain
----------

rain.pause()


Resume rain
-----------

rain.resume()


You can find example of usage in `main.lua` file.
It is fully working example so just run it in the emulator.


Rain config

* length - drop length

* alpha - transparency of the drop
* color - drop color, defaulu is white

Any suggestions?
